# Sagittarius — `package.json` (intended)

> Documents the `package.json` to be created in `gengyveusa/obsidian-claude-conduit` during Phase 2 (scaffold). Versions reflect cutoff state; bump when the new repo is initialized.

> **Update 2026-05-06 (per [[2026-05-06-sqlite-shipping-strategy|ADR-011]]):** `better-sqlite3` was replaced with `sql.js`. The provisional Curator answer in [[02_SPEC|spec §10 Q2]] ("better-sqlite3 — speed wins") was made before measuring Obsidian's distribution cost; native `.node` bindings have no canonical install path through `main.js`-only releases, and three prior plugins document this as adoption-blocking. ADR-011 §"Decision" has the full reasoning.

## Dependency rationale (why each)

| Dep | Why |
|---|---|
| `@anthropic-ai/sdk` | The canonical Claude SDK. Per [[20-Decisions/2026-05-04-sagittarius-q1-q3-signoff\|ADR-007 Q1]] = (a) Direct SDK primary. |
| `@xenova/transformers` | Provides `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` via ONNX-WASM in the browser/Node. Required to honor the [[Assets/code/corpus-ingest/parsers/embed_interface\|embedding contract]]'s "same model as corpus-ingest." Bundle cost ~3MB; model file ~22MB downloaded on first index. |
| `sql.js` | SQLite as WASM, pure-JS. Per [[2026-05-06-sqlite-shipping-strategy\|ADR-011]]: bundleable into a single `main.js` via esbuild's binary loader — no per-platform native bindings to ship. Slower than `better-sqlite3` (~5–10×) but adequate for v0.1 vault sizes; revisit in Phase 5 if perf bites. |
| `yaml` | Frontmatter parsing. Standard. |
| `zod` | Tool input/output schema validation at the agent's tool-call boundary. Each tool's input_schema gets a paired Zod schema for runtime validation. |

### Dev dependency rationale

| Dep | Why |
|---|---|
| `obsidian` | Plugin API types. `peerDependency`-style; not bundled. |
| `esbuild` | The canonical Obsidian plugin build tool. Single `main.js` bundle. WASM binary loader is enabled for sql.js's `sql-wasm.wasm` per ADR-011. |
| `vitest` | Per killer prompt §4 — "vitest for units, playwright for the Obsidian test harness." Phase 1 focuses on vitest; playwright in Phase 2. |
| `eslint` + `@typescript-eslint/*` | Strict TS lint (per killer prompt §9 — "no `any` except at FFI boundaries with a `// TODO: type` note"). |
| `prettier` | Format consistency. Configure with single-quotes, trailing commas, 100 char line width to match contemporary TS style. |
| `tslib` | Required for `importHelpers: true` in tsconfig (smaller bundle). |
| `typescript` | Compiler. Strict mode required by killer prompt §4. |
| `builtin-modules` | Esbuild needs to know which modules are Node builtins to externalize. |
| `@types/sql.js` | TypeScript definitions for sql.js. Tracks the runtime version. |

## Versions to revisit at Phase 2 kickoff

The version pins above are "current at cutoff." When Thad creates the repo, run `npm install --save-exact` to lock to the latest at that moment. Pin exact versions (no `^` prefix) per [[20-Decisions/2026-05-04-sagittarius-build-process\|ADR-010]]'s "no telemetry default" stance — supply-chain hygiene.

## Scripts rationale

- `build` — production build (minified, single `main.js` + `styles.css` per Obsidian convention).
- `dev` — watch mode build for fast iteration.
- `test` — unit tests via vitest.
- `test:integration` — integration tests against a fixture vault under `test/fixtures/vault/` per killer prompt §4.
- `lint`, `format`, `typecheck` — quality gates per killer prompt §9.
- `version-bump` — Obsidian plugins require coordinated bumps in `manifest.json` + `versions.json` + `package.json`. Single script handles all three.
- `release` — meta-script: build + test + version-bump. Manual `git push --tags` + GitHub release follow.

## What this file is NOT

- Not the source of truth — once `gengyveusa/obsidian-claude-conduit/package.json` is created, that file is canonical. This vault file is **the design intent**.
- Not version-locked — version pins here are guidance; Phase 2 kickoff will install latest and lock-exact at that moment.

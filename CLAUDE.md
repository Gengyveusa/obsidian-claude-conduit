# CLAUDE.md — agent shim for `obsidian-claude-conduit`

This file orients a Claude Code session opened against this repo. Substrate questions ("what's the spec? what tools? what schema?") defer to `docs/`.

## Repo identity

- **Name:** Sagittarius — Claude Conduit (`obsidian-claude-conduit`)
- **What:** Native Obsidian plugin. Chat with your vault, retrieval-grounded.
- **Status:** v1.3.2 — ChatView Draft mode lands, closing ADR-026 D5(d)+D6(c). When the active file is under `_drafts/`, ChatView shows a "Refining draft: <path>" banner above the messages area and `chat()` is called with the draft path. The agent's system prompt gains a "Mode: DRAFT REFINE" block instructing `patch_note(path='<draft>', ...)` for line edits or whole-body rewrites; explicit "do NOT propose writes to other paths" guardrail. Banner refreshes on `active-leaf-change`. Zero new tools; existing `patch_note` does the work. 1031 tests (+4). Earlier today (v1.3.1): Phase 10 polish slice 1 (README rewrite, CSS gaps, fundingUrl, Phase 11 release-prep docs in `docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` + `docs/COMMUNITY_PLUGIN_SUBMISSION.md`). README rewritten to reflect v1.3.0 capabilities (was stale at v0.2.5; now covers all 8 phases with Install/Setup/Daily commands/Memory cascade/MCP bridge/Drafting workflow/Phase map sections). styles.css gained classes for the drafts side panel (`.sagittarius-drafts*`), the chat-response memory footer (`.sagittarius-meta-memory`), and status bar pills (`.sagittarius-status-bar`). manifest.json `fundingUrl` set to GitHub Sponsors. No code changes; 1027 tests still pass. Phase 11 release prep (signed tag, GitHub release artifacts, community-registry submission draft) follows in this same session. Phase 9 MVP shipped earlier today at v1.3.0 (ADR-029). New `src/memory/` package: `MemoryCascade.ts` (pure — `collectMemory`, `candidateCascadePaths`, `formatMemoryPromptText`, `formatMemoryFooter`; root + every ancestor folder of the active file per D2; soft-truncate at 50KB per D4), `LiveMemoryProvider.ts` (plugin-side `MemoryProvider` impl reading the workspace's active file per turn per D6, with `preview()` for UI without polluting `lastResult`). `ConduitAgent` gains an optional `memoryProvider` dep; `buildSystemPrompt` inserts the memory block between constitution and hangarVoice with its own `cache_control: ephemeral` breakpoint per D5 so CLAUDE.md edits don't invalidate the constitution cache. Provider errors degrade to "no memory" rather than failing the turn. Status bar pill ("memory: 2.1KB" / "memory: none" / "memory: off") click opens a preview modal listing the cascade. ChatView response footer gains a memory line ("memory: 2.1KB from CLAUDE.md, 30-Projects/CLAUDE.md") via the provider's `lastResult`. Two new settings: `memoryEnabled` (default true), `memoryMaxBytes` (default 50_000). **Zero new write tools** — agent proposes memory edits via existing `append_to_note` / `patch_note` per ADR-029 D8 (echoes ADR-028 lesson 2). 1027 tests (+34). Phase 9 stays open at v1.3.0; close (ADR-???) lands as a later v1.3.x after the cascade is exercised in real use. Phase 8 closed yesterday (ADR-028). Generative drafting MVP + drafts management panel ship together. `Sagittarius: New draft` → `NewDraftModal` → retrieval-grounded `AnthropicDraftingEngine` → `create_note` via the existing diff card → file lands at `_drafts/<destination>/<slug>.md` with inline `[[]]` citations + `cited_chunks: [...]` frontmatter. New `DraftsView` right-rail side panel lists every file under `_drafts/` with Open/Promote/Discard buttons; new status bar pill ("Sagittarius: N drafts") hides when empty. `Sagittarius: Promote draft` strips the `_drafts/` prefix via `move_note`. Three new settings: `draftingModel` (Opus 4.7 default per D4), `citationPolicy` (`marked` default per D3 — uncited prose wrapped in `<!-- uncited -->` comments), `draftsDefaultDestination` (`10-Inbox` default). **Zero new write tools, zero new diff-card variants, zero new transaction shapes** — Phase 8 composes existing primitives per D9 (a). 993 tests (+62 since Phase 6.7 close). ChatView Draft mode (D5 (d) + D6 (c)) deferred to v1.2.x patch. Phase 8 done; Phase 9 (memory layer) is next. The MCP bridge now exposes 5 read tools always, 9 write tools when `mcpWriteEnabled`, plus `delete_note` behind a second toggle. The diff-card-focus problem (deferred by ADR-023 lesson 2 → solved + closed ~24 h later) is fully solved for the user-not-at-Obsidian case via `ExternalProposalQueue` + side panel + status bar pill + native OS `Notification`. McpHandler races `registry.execute` against `mcpWriteQueueTimeoutMs` (default 30 s); on timeout the MCP response returns `queued` while the underlying tool keeps running and commits when the user approves later. ADR-025 OQ1 settled: side-panel Approve resolves directly (inline diff preview makes a re-opened modal redundant). The in-app-chat-concurrent case returns "retry shortly" — accepted limitation per ADR-027 lesson 2. 931 tests. Phase 6.7 done; ADR-026 (Phase 8 — generative layer) MVP at v1.2.0 is next.
- **Build pattern:** `pair-via-claude-code` per [`docs/2026-05-04-sagittarius-build-process.md`](docs/2026-05-04-sagittarius-build-process.md) (ADR-010). Thad decides; Claude implements.

## Decision authority hierarchy

When unsure (per ADR-010 §4):

1. Match against `docs/02_SPEC.md` + ADR-007 + ADR-009 + ADR-010 + the embedding contract → proceed.
2. Spec doesn't cover this? → propose a conservative default; flag in PR.
3. Deviation from spec? → STOP. Surface in PR. Wait for Thad.
4. Architectural change? → file an ADR draft in `docs/`. Don't merge.

## Quality gates (per spec §8)

- **Types:** no `any` except FFI boundaries with a `// TODO: type` comment.
- **Tests:** every tool gets a unit test; tests ship with the feature.
- **Errors:** every thrown error is actionable.
- **Docs:** every exported function gets a one-line purpose + example.

## House rules (from `docs/THAD_MAN.md`)

1. Never auto-respond to a FortressFlow reply.
2. The vault is the system of record.
3. First principles. Complexity science. No buzzword soup.
4. Failures get a one-line lesson.

## Scope of this repo

- **In scope:** TypeScript plugin code, tests, build/CI, docs.
- **Out of scope:** vault content (lives in the operator's private `gengyveusa/my-obsidian-vault`), spec amendments without an ADR, architectural pivots, auto-merging your own PRs, adding deps not listed in `docs/03_PACKAGE_JSON.md` without surfacing rationale.
